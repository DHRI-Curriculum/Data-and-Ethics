# What Constitutes Research Data?

"Material or information on which an argument, theory, test or hypothesis, or another research output is based."
Queensland University of Technology. Manual of Procedures and Policies. Section 2.8.3. http://www.mopp.qut.edu.au/D/D_02_08.jsp

"What constitutes such data will be determined by the community of interest through the process of peer review and program management. This may include, but is not limited to: data, publications, samples, physical collections, software and models"
Marieke Guy. http://www.slideshare.net/MariekeGuy/bridging-the-gap-between-researchers-and-research-data-management , #2

"Units of information created in the course of research"
https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmpfaqs.jsp

"(i) Research data is defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues."
OMB-110, Subpart C, section 36, (d) (i), http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a110/

In summary, research data is:
## Material or information necessary to come to your conclusion.

# Forms of Data

There are many ways to represent data, just as there are many sources of data. After processing our data, we turn it into a number of products. For example:

Non-digital text (lab books, field notebooks)

Digital texts or digital copies of text

Spreadsheets

Audio, video

Computer Aided Design/CAD

Statistical analysis (SPSS, SAS)

Databases

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial data

Digital copies of images

Web files

Scientific sample collections

Matlab files & 3D Models

Metadata & Paradata

Data visualizations

Computer code

Standard operating procedures and protocols

Protein or genetic sequences

Artistic products

Curriculum materials

Collection of digital objects acquired and generated during research

These are some (most!) of the shapes your research data might transform into.

# Stages of Data

We begin without data. Then it is observed, or made, or imagined, or generated. After that, it goes through further transformations:

1. Raw
    Raw data is yet to be processed, meaning it has yet to be manipulated by a human or computer. Raw data might have errors in it, for instance: 
    1. Empty fields
    2. Multiple formats, such as "yes" or "y" or "1" for a positive response.
    3. Suspect answers, like a date of birth of 00/11/1234
    4. Impossible negative numbers, like an age of "-37"
    5. Dubious outliers
    6. Duplicated rows
    7. And many more!
    But "raw data" is a relative term, inasmuch as when one person finishes processing data and presents it as a finished product, another person may take that product and work on it further, and for them that data is "raw data".
2. Cleaned
    High quality data is measured in its validity, accuracy, completeness and consistency.
    Cleaning data is the work of correcting the errors listed above. It can be done manually or programatically. It also involves normalizing data, for example, making sure phone numbers have ten digits ((555)-555-5555), not just seven (555-5555).

    ## Validity
    Measurements must be valid, in that they must conform to set constraints:
    1. The aforementioned "yes" or "y" or "1" should all be changed to one response.
    2. Certain fields cannot be empty, or the whole observation must be thrown out.
    3. Uniqueness, for instance no two people should have the same social security number.
    ## Accuracy
    
3. Processed
4. Analyzed
5. Visualized

Data does not have to go through all five steps.


1. Each variable is in a column.
2. Each observation is a row.
3. Each value is a cell.
