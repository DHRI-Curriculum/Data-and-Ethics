# Theory to Practice

## Suggested Further Readings

### Data management
- Marieke Guy's [data management presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/MariekeGuy/bridging-the-gap-between-researchers-and-research-data-management) discusses some ideas around planning for data management before, during, and after a project.
- Queensland University of Technology's [Management of Research Data](http://www.mopp.qut.edu.au/D/D_02_08.jsp) provides some ideas around ownership, roles and responsibilities of data-driven projects (specific to Queensland University of Technology but may be useful to understand different roles in a research project).
- The Graduate Center, CUNY's [Data Management](https://libguides.gc.cuny.edu/c.php?g=159618&p=1045072) research guide provides resources and specific steps for CUNY faculty, staff, and students. 

### Ethics and ("big" data) research
- The Council for Big Data, Ethics, and Society's [Perspectives on Big Data, Ethics, and Society](https://bdes.datasociety.net/council-output/perspectives-on-big-data-ethics-and-society/) is a white paper that consolidates the councils discussions around big data, ethics, and society.
- Catherine D'Ignazio & Lauren F. Klein's [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/). Scroll down the page to access the book chapters for free. It looks at "big" data from a feminist perspective, and discuss the importance of understanding long histories and socio-political concerns into research, as well as an overview of the field.
- Feminist Data [Manifest-No](https://www.manifestno.com) discusses the realities of "big" data and the fallacies of unequal harm and risk distribution, particularly towards marginalized communities.
- Mimi Onuoha's [Missing Data Sets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets) looks at "blank spots that exist in spaces that are otherwise data-saturated," that usually affect those who are the most vulnerable.

## Other Tutorials

- [Computational social science with R](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/curriculum#day_2) by the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science. This is a 2-week summer institute program that follows the [Bit By Bit: Social Research in Digital Age](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/) format. The current repository (Jul, 2020) contains workshops and materials from the institute. 
- The European Data Portal's tutorial on [Open Data](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/elearning/en/module9/#/id/co-01) offers a guided insight to the importance of choosing the right format for open datasets.
- [The Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/search.html) by Severino Ribecca provides a guide to data visualizations for different types of data and narratives.
- [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) by From Data to Viz also provides a guide to data visualization for different types of data and narratives.

## Projects or Challenges to Try

- Consider a project where you are interested in the global trend of political views. You've decided to look at the [2018 European Social Survey](http://nesstar.ess.nsd.uib.no/webview/index.jsp?v=2&previousmode=table&regMod=corr&submode=variable&analysismode=table&study=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.83%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FESS9e02.0&gs=undefined&variable=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.83%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FESS9e02.0_V93&mode=documentation&top=yes) and the U.S.-based [2018 General Social Survey](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/vfilter?utf8=%E2%9C%93&user_search_id=&state_id=&search_type=&keyword=politic&doslider=0&yrmin=1972&yrmax=2018&years=2018&subjects=&ssearch=&commit=SEARCH). How would you approach the data? 
    - If you're interested in reporting on the trend of global political views, what do you have to consider if you were joining these data sets based on the survey items and its responses? 
    - What assumptions do you make? How would you collapse responses? 

## Discussion Questions

- How does increased data literacy add to your project planning? 
- How do you address your use of data and your ethics? How might ethics play a part in the way you
    - think about data collection?
    - think about anonymity and confidentiality beyond IRB (Institutional Review Board) regulations?
    - think about data and its relation to the communities it emerges from?
- Consider your next project, what are some considerations from this workshop that you might bring into your project?
