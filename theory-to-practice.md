## Discussion Questions

- What are some forms of data you use in your work? What about forms of data that you produce as your output? Perhaps there are some forms that are typical of your field? Where do you usually get your data from?
- What is publically available data?
- How do you decide the formats to store your data when you transition from 'raw' to 'processed/transformed' data? What are some of your considerations?
- How do we know when our data is cleaned enough? What happens to the data that is removed? What are we choosing to say about our dataset as we prepare them for analysis?
- As we consider the types of analysis that we choose to apply onto our data set, what are we representing and leaving out? How do we guide our decisions of interpretation with our choices of analyses? Are we comfortable with the (un)intended use of our research? What are potential misuses of our outputs? 
- What can happen when we are trying to just go for the next big thing (tool/methods/algorithms) or just ran out of time and/or budget for our project?
- What are we assuming when we choose to visually represent data in particular ways? How can data visualization mislead us?
