## Projects or Challenges to Try

- Consider a project where you are interested in the global trend of political views. You've decided to look at the [2018 European Social Survey](http://nesstar.ess.nsd.uib.no/webview/index.jsp?v=2&previousmode=table&regMod=corr&submode=variable&analysismode=table&study=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.83%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FESS9e02.0&gs=undefined&variable=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.83%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FESS9e02.0_V93&mode=documentation&top=yes) and the U.S.-based [2018 General Social Survey](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/vfilter?utf8=%E2%9C%93&user_search_id=&state_id=&search_type=&keyword=politic&doslider=0&yrmin=1972&yrmax=2018&years=2018&subjects=&ssearch=&commit=SEARCH). How would you approach the data? 
    - If you're interested in reporting on the trend of global political views, what do you have to consider if you were joining these data sets based on the survey items and its responses? 
    - What assumptions do you make? How would you collapse responses? 

## Discussion Questions

- How does increased data literacy add to your project planning? 
- How do you address your use of data and your ethics? How might ethics play a part in the way you
    - think about data collection?
    - think about anonymity and confidentiality beyond IRB (Institutional Review Board) regulations?
    - think about data and its relation to the communities it emerges from?
- Consider your next project, what are some considerations from this workshop that you might bring into your project?
