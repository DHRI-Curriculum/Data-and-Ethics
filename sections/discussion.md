Discussion
================

Throughout the workshop we have been thinking together through some of
the potential ethical concerns that might crop up as we proceed with our
own projects. Just as we have disucssed thus far, we hope that you see
that data and ethics is an ongoing process throughout the lifespans of
your project(s) and don’t often come with easy answers.

## Activity

In this final activity, we would like for you to think about some of the
potential concerns that might come up in the scenario below and discuss
how you might approach them:

You are interested in looking at the reactions to the democratic party
presidential debates across time. You decided that you would use data
from twitter to analyze the responses. After collecting your data, you
learned that your data has information from users who were later banned
and included some tweets that were removed/deleted from the site.

#### If you would like some guiding questions:

  - Would your approach differ if the responses were anonymized v. not?
  - Would the number of tweets generated impact your decisions?
  - How might where you are at in your project (e.g. "raw" data v. "cleaned" data v. analysed) affect your choices?

## Some concluding thoughts

Data and ethics are contextually driven. As such, there isn’t always a
risk-free approach. We often have to work through ethical dilemmas while
thinking through information that we may not have (what are the risks of
doing/not doing this work?). We may be approaching a moment where the
question is no longer what we could do but what we should do.
