# What Constitutes Research Data?

"Material or information on which an argument, theory, test or hypothesis, or another research output is based."
Queensland University of Technology. Manual of Procedures and Policies. Section 2.8.3. http://www.mopp.qut.edu.au/D/D_02_08.jsp

"What constitutes such data will be determined by the community of interest through the process of peer review and program management. This may include, but is not limited to: data, publications, samples, physical collections, software and models"
Marieke Guy. http://www.slideshare.net/MariekeGuy/bridging-the-gap-between-researchers-and-research-data-management , #2

"Units of information created in the course of research"
https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmpfaqs.jsp

"(i) Research data is defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues."
OMB-110, Subpart C, section 36, (d) (i), http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a110/

In summary, research data is:
## Material or information necessary to come to your conclusion.

# Forms of Data

There are many ways to represent data, just as there are many sources of data. After processing our data, we turn it into a number of products. For example:

*Non-digital text (lab books, field notebooks)

*Digital texts or digital copies of text

*Spreadsheets

*Audio, video

*Computer Aided Design/CAD

*Statistical analysis (SPSS, SAS)

*Databases

*Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial data

*Digital copies of images

*Web files

*Scientific sample collections

*Matlab files & 3D Models

*Metadata & Paradata

*Data visualizations

*Computer code

*Standard operating procedures and protocols

*Protein or genetic sequences

*Artistic products

*Curriculum materials

*Collection of digital objects acquired and generated during research

These are some (most!) of the shapes your research data might transform into.
