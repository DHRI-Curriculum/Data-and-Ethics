# Data Literacies

## Abstract

What is data? What counts as data? These are questions we will explore throughout the workshop.   

Data is foundational to nearly all digital projects and often help us to understand and express our ideas and narratives. Hence, in order to do digital work, we should know how data is captured, constructed, and manipulated. In this workshop we will be discussing the basics of research data, in terms of its material, transformation, and presentation. We will also engage with the ethical dimensions of what it means to work with data, from collection to visualization to representation. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Know the stages of data analysis
- Understand the difference between proprietary and open data formats
- Become familiar with the specific requirements of "high quality data"
- Learn about ethical issues around working with different types of data and analysis

## Estimated time

- 3–4 hours

## Prerequisites

- Introduction to Command Line
- Download [`moSmall.csv`](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/data-literacies/blob/v2.0/files/moSmall.csv) dataset. It will be used through the challenges in the workshop.
    - To save the file onto your local computer, **right click** on the `Download` button (top right-hand corner of the `View raw` message) and choose `Save Link As...`.  Original dataset taken from [The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Creative Commons Zero](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess). 

## Contexts

### Pre-reading suggestions

- In [Big? Smart? Clean? Messy? Data in the Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-3/big-smart-clean-messy-data-in-the-humanities/), Christof Schöch discusses what data means in the humanities and the necessity of "smart big data."
- The book, [Bit By Bit: Social Research in Digital Age](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/), written by Matthew Salganik, approaches data and social research from a computational social science perspective. He also discusses the idea of "readymade" and "custommade" data alongside ethics.
- [Ten Simple Rules for Responsible Big Data Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5373508/) explores some guidelines for addressing complex ethical issues that arise in any research project.  


### Projects that use these skills

- The [Data for Public Good](https://dataforgood.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) is a semester-long collaborative project led by CUNY graduate students. Each semester, a different public-interest dataset is explored to present information that is useful and informative to a public audience.
- [SAFElab](https://safelab.socialwork.columbia.edu/), led by Dr. Desmond U. Patton, uses computational and social work approaches to understand the mechanisms of violence and work on prevention and intervention in violence that occur in neighborhoods and on social media. 

### Ethical Considerations  

- Data and data analysis is [not free from bias](https://medium.com/@angebassa/data-alone-isnt-ground-truth-9e733079dfd4). There is no magic blackbox for which data emerges from and is contextually driven. As we think about the automation process of looking at "big" data, we have to be aware of [the biases that gets reproduced that is "hidden."](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)
- De-identified information can be [reconstructed from piecemeal data](https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/) found across different sources. When we consider what we are doing with the data we have collected, we also need to think about the possible re-identification of our participants. 
- Big data projects often times requiring sharing data sets across different individuals and teams. In addition, to ensure that our work is reproducible and accountable, we may also feel inclined to share the data collected. As such, figuring out [how to share such data](https://techscience.org/a/2015101601/) is crucial in the project planning stage.
