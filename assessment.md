# Assessment

## Quantitative Self-Assessment

Before beginning the workshop, how confident did you feel about the idea of data literacies?

- I've explored and applied the concepts introduced in data literacies on a variety of data types and formats, so this was nothing new to me.
- I've some experience in applying the concepts introduced in data literacies, but felt I could get a better understanding.
- I've done some rudimentary exploration, but I have not considered the process through the concepts in data literacies.
- I have heard about data literacies before, but I have not explored it myself.
- I didn't know what makes up data literacies was about and have no experience with it.

After completing the data literacies workshop, I would say that:

- I learned very little.
- I modestly increased my confidence around the concepts introduced in data literacies.
- I discovered new ways to think about data through the concepts introduced in data literacies.
- I significantly increased my capacity to think about data through the concepts introduced in data literacies.
